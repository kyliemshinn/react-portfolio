## Description

This portfolio project showcases all the relevant projects and work experience through my resume I have thus far with web development. I chose my strongest projects that show the progression in web development I have made at this point. The theme of this project was meant to be simple and sweet, with a minimalistic feel- a style that expresses me and my style in general. I wanted to switch it up a bit from past themes of recent project to work with different colors. I created my own logo through Canva that I have as my title link. I wanted to keep the navigation bar very simple so I decided to leave the logo off of the site.  This is designed to be an easy to use, simpler web portfolio that is showcased on a single page.
